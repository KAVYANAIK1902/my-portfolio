Build a task management application to help users organize their tasks, set deadlines, and track progress. Users can create tasks, assign categories and priorities, and schedule due dates. The application includes user authentication for secure access and data privacy. Users can view their tasks in a list or calendar view, receive notifications for upcoming deadlines, and collaborate with team members.
